# latex-templates

This is where I keep my LaTeX document templates. Feel free to use them yourself - if you're feeling
generous, give me attribution for the template in a comment or something, but you definitely don't
have to. I made this because I love using LaTeX for my documents, and you should too.

To start using these templates, I recommend the following:

```bash
# these two commands only need to be run once
cd ~/Documents
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/stanekondrej/latex-templates.git

mkdir projectXYZ && cd projectXYZ
cp ~/Documents/latex-templates/regular.tex main.tex # you can choose something else than regular.tex
$EDITOR main.tex
```
